This is the GitHub homepage for my upcoming book:

"Exploring University Mathematics with Python" by Siri Chongchitnan (Springer, 2023).

Here are some ways you can use the codes.
- JupyterLab & Notebook: uncomment the magic command "%matplotlib" wherever it appears (and find the right backend that works for you. To see a list of available backends on your machine, type matplotlib -l
- Spyder: set graphics backend to automatic (look under preference>IPython console>graphics backend)
- Replit.com: should run as is
