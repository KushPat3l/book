This is the GitHub homepage for my upcoming book:

"Exploring University Mathematics with Python" by Siri Chongchitnan (Springer, 2023).

- Jupyter environment: uncommment the magic command %matplotlib
- Spyder: set graphics backend to automatic (look under preference>IPython console>graphics backend)
- Replit.com: should run as is
