This is the GitHub homepage for my upcoming book:

"Exploring University Mathematics with Python" by Siri Chongchitnan (Springer, 2023).

Here are some ways you can use the codes.
- Jupyter environment: uncommment the magic command "%matplotlib" wherever it appears.
- Spyder: set graphics backend to automatic (look under preference>IPython console>graphics backend).
- Replit.com: should run as is.
