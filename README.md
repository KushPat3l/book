This is the GitHub homepage for my upcoming book:

"Exploring University Mathematics with Python" by Siri Chongchitnan (Springer, 2023).

Here are some ways you can use the codes.
- (Default option) ipynb files (for JupyterLab & Notebook): download the .ipynb files and open them on your Jupyter environment. If "%matplotlib" causes an error, find the right graphics backend that works for you. To see a list of available backends on your machine, type matplotlib -l
- py files (for IDLE, Spyder, Pycharm etc.): download the .py files and run. For Spyder, set graphics backend to automatic (look under preference>IPython console>graphics backend).
