This is the GitHub homepage for my upcoming book:

"Exploring University Mathematics with Python" by Siri Chongchitnan (Springer, 2023).

The easiest way to use the codes is to download the file and run it in your Jupyter environment. Do not click "copy raw content" - the raw content has lots of irrelevant bits of code.

In some coding environments (e.g. Spyder or replit.com), you may need to change the file extension to .py. You may also need to remove magic commands like %matplotlib.
