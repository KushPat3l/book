This is the GitHub homepage for my upcoming book:

"Exploring University Mathematics with Python" by Siri Chongchitnan (Springer, 2023).

Here are some ways you can use the codes.
- (Default option) JupyterLab & Notebook: download the .ipynb files and open them on your Jupyter environment. If "%matplotlib" causes an error, find the right graphics backend that works for you. To see a list of available backends on your machine, type matplotlib -l
- Spyder: download the .py files and set graphics backend to automatic (look under preference>IPython console>graphics backend). However, some codes will only run in the Jupyter environment, in which case the py version won't be provided.
- Replit.com: download the .py files. Same caveat as Spyder.
